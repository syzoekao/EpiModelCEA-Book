# Program Scenarios to be Modeled

## Primary Outcomes
  - Number of new HIV infections
  - Total DAP spending

## Secondary Outcomes
  - Proportion virally suppressed
  - Proportion of HIV- people on PrEP
  - ADAP program size and cost
  - PDAP program size and cost

## Potential Scenarios

0. **Status quo**.
  - keep PDAP size the same
  - keep ADAP coverage the same
1. **Increase PDAP Program Size**
  - for example, from 600 to 2000 people
2. **Increase ADAP coverage**
  - for example, increase the percentage of eligibles who are enrolled
  from 70% (hypothetically) to 90%
3. **Increase pool of those eligible for ADAP**
  - for example, increasing income cutoff from 400% to 500% FPL
4. **Elimination of Drug Subsidies for ART**
  - how this affects ADAP spending
5. **Combinations**
6. **Others?**
