# Objective
* Washington state has programs that help people get medications to treat HIV and to prevent HIV acquisition
  - AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP)
  - PrEP Drug Assistance Program (PDAP)
* The objective of the costing component of WHAMP is to add functionality to EpiModelHIV that allows us to:
  - project ADAP and PDAP costs over time
  - evaluate scenarios that would lead to expanding or restricting ADAP and PDAP programs
* To model these programs, we need information on:
  - program eligibility
  - enrollment and disengagement processes
  - services provided by the programs
  - costs for the provided services
  - how the programs affect care outcomes
* This presentation outlines:
  - our conceptual model of the DAP program dynamics and their effects on care outcomes
  - how we plan to inform the conceptual model with data
  - required changes to EpiModelHIV
  - potential scenarios we could evaluate
  - progress and a timeline for the next year
