# People Living With HIV/AIDS

##<div id="ADAPandContinuum">ADAP and care continuum</div>


Upon entering the model, each individual is assigned to one of the care trajectories, based on their individual attributes (e.g. income, insurance, etc.)

The four trajectories are:

- **T1**: Never test
- **T2**: Test and never treat
- **T3**: Treat with partial suppression
- **T4**: Treat with full suppression

Within each of these trajectories, there can be variation in care over time. For example, someone in T4 may stop taking ART.

ADAP affects the trajectories in the following ways:

* Without ADAP, only individuals in T3 and T4 can engage in care and enter into the ART treatment dynamics.
* For individuals on T3/T4, ADAP modifies the ART dynamics. This can lead to a longer duration of ART treatment and fewer gaps in ART treatment.
* With ADAP, individuals who are on T2 may be able to obtain ART treatment and engage in care.
* In addition, individual attributes influence the probability that a person diagnosed with HIV enrolls in ADAP.

In addition to being assigned a trajectory upon model entry, individuals are also assigned "ADAP" or "no ADAP", Only these people may enter the ADAP program.

The trajectory and ADAP/no ADAP assignment is illustrated below:

, where $$tt_x$$ refers to the test/treat trajectory to which an indiviudal was assigned.


* Individuals could change ADAP status because of changes in income and insurance, or because of failing recertification.
* ADAP status migth increase ART initiation and reinitiation and decrease ART stoppage.

**Questions**

* Does everyone immediately initiate ART after enrollment?
* Is engaging in care a requirement for recertification?
* Are there records of diagnosed date prior to enrollment?

## <div id="ADAPcost">ADAP cost</div>
* Client costs
    - Insurance premium (if insurance is ADAP-sponsored)
    - Copay, coinsurance, deductible for:
      - ART
      - HIV-related medical services
      - Other medical services
* Assessment cost
* Overhead


**Questions**

* On average, what is the ratio of enrollments to applications for ADAP in a year?
