# People Who Do Not Have HIV

##<div id="PDAPandContinuum">PrEP-DAP and care continuum</div>

* **Recommended**: PrEP is recommended for people who meet the following criteria:
    - Diagnosed with rectal gonorrhea or syphilis in the past 12 months.
    - Ongoing sexual relationships with HIV+ partners who are not virally suppressed or not on ART
* **Discussed**: Providers should discuss use of PrEP with a person who meets the following criteria:
    - Have unprotected sex outside of mutually monogamous partnerships with a man who is HIV-.
    - Diagnosed with gonorrhea or chlamydia in the past 12 months.
    - Ongoing sexual partnerships with HIV+ who are virally suppressed.
* **No PrEP indication**: does not meet criteria for "Recommend" or "Discuss"
* Only individuals who are aware of and interested in PrEP can be enrolled in PrEP-DAP
* PrEP-DAP modifies the PrEP dynamics.

**Parameters**

Note: in the WHPP summary, they split people up first by indication and then by awareness + interest.
That may make more conceptual sense. Also, since R/D/N is evaluated at each time step, we
might want to put that first.

##<div id="PrEPdynamics">PrEP and PrEP-DAP dynamics</div>

![PrEPdynamics](figures/PrEPdynamics.png)

* In the PrEP dynamics, we considered PrEP indication dynamics and PrEP-DAP dynamics.
* Changes in PrEP indication dynamics are resulted in changes in partnerships and STI dynamics.
* In addition to the changes in partnerships and STI dynamics, PrEP-DAP dynamics might also depend on and the behaviors of meeting the requirements of the program.

**Questions**

* Does everyone immediately initiate PrEP after enrollment?
* Are there records of diagnosed date prior to enrollment?

## <div id="PDAPcost">PrEP-DAP cost</div>
* Client costs
    - Copays, coinsurance, and/or deductible for:
      - PrEP medication, after Gilead benefits are exhausted
      - Medical and lab visits
      - STI treatment
      - Other relevant healthcare (selective services)
* Assessment cost
* Overhead

**Questions**

* On average, what is the ratio of enrollments to applications for PrEP-DAP in a year?
